1.Creating a procedure to swap the places of integers
 - Creating three variables integers X,y as the 2 provided Integers z will be the the integer hosting the x value while swapping x and y
 Main Algorithm
2.The variable n is assigned the length of the array A.
3.We will use a for function to go through the array for position 1 to n-1 .
4.The inner while loop starts at the current index i of the outer for loop and compares each element to its left neighbor. If an element is smaller than its left neighbor, the elements are swapped using the procedure we created
5.The inner while loop continues to move an element to the left as long as it is smaller than the element to its left.
6.Once the inner while loop is finished, the element at the current index is in its correct position.
7.The outer for loop continues through the array until all elements are in their correct positions and the array is fully sorted.
